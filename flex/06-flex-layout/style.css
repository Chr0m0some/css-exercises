/* Solutions */
/* Explanation:
      The main trouble I had with this problem was knowing how to create space.
    I initially put justify-content: space-between in the body so that the header
    and footer would be pushed to the start and end line while the content
    would be aligned to the middle using align-items: center. However logical this
    was, it was not the best way to go about it. The best way to go about this was
    to use flex shorthand to make the content grow and fill the empty space in the middle
    pushing the footer down. Although, both work. I think it's nice to implement 
    flex grow and shrink.
      Furthermore, I learned how to style links and get rid of the underline. */
